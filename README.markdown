## About Ribbot

Standard online forums often lead to low quality discussions. Sites like Hacker News, Reddit, StackOverflow, and 37Signals Answers have pioneered a new format for forums that leads to higher quality content. They are characterized by a number of features including post ranking, user reputation, crowd sourcing, and threaded discussions.

Ribbot seeks to allow any company or online community to setup a similar forum and build a high quality community online.

Ribbot was created by Brian Armstrong in 2011 in San Francisco, CA.

## Contributing

* Feel free to fork, and submit pull requests
* Be sure to run the test suite to make sure nothing broke, and please add a new test for new functionality (especially high level request/integration specs)
* You can keep tests running continually in the background while developing with `guard` (this is preferred) or one off using `rspec spec`
